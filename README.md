# approximating-pi-visual-and-graph-representation
Java project that tries to approximate the value of pi with probability.

Files included are the .java files, processing graphics library and font (open project in IDE)

INSTRUCTIONS:

◘ Press '1' and '2' to switch between circle/points and graph representation
◘ Press 'r' to restart
◘ use clicking/draging and the scroll wheel to move around graph

• Changing the "sample size" variable (which controls the max number of points being calculated to find pi) can change how the graph looks 10 vs. 1000
• Increasing the "speed" variable makes the circle and points visualization more fun to watch 

The ratio of a inscribed circle and a square is pi/4 => (pi*r^2 / 4*r^2)
The probability of a dot to land in the circle compared to the total number of dots in the square * 4 can approach pi if enough dots are calculated
